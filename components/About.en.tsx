        Spetito (<b>Spe</b>nd<b> ti</b>me<b> to</b>gether) is simple social
        network for giving non-binding offers to your friends, and vice versa
        parties, for a comprehensive overview of all offers from your friends.
        Offers they might look like this:
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>
          I&apos;m going to bike the Košice singletrails. I welcome the biker
          company.
        </li>

        <li>
          I will be at the cottage in the evening, I will be pleased with the
          visit. The beer is chilled. Before please contact me.
        </li>

        <li>
          This weekend I am planning a trip from Štrbské pleso to Kriváň.
          Companions, report. The weather is supposed to be per unit.
        </li>

        <li>
          I will go from Košice to Bratislava on Friday and I will return on
          Sunday. if someone needs some transportation, let me write.
        </li>

        <li>
          I bake a great raw cake and I hope I won&apos;t eat it alone at home.
        </li>

        <li>I teach math 😜</li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        Sharing groups are also planned in the near future similar interests,
        ideally in the same location, for example:
        <i>Košice dogs</i>, <i>Prešov tourists</i>,
        <i>The lonely souls of Nitra</i>etc.
      </p>

      <h2>Why Facebook is not suitable for this?</h2>

      <p>
        Although Facebook contains events and it is also possible to post offers
        in messages, but it contains a lot of other things that make it
        impossible search for all relevant offers. The events on Facebook
        themselves are understood as invitations, while at Spetite they are
        (non-binding) offers, in the form of similar advertisement, but only
        within the circle of friends. Few people will create a Facebook event
        that makes you go a little jogging tonight and would love to he had some
        company in the process. Spetito is ideal for such offers.
      </p>

      <p>
        In addition, Facebook is full of irrelevant sponsored posts and
        advertising. You&apos;ll also never find some friends on Facebook,
        because not everyone &quot;loves him&quot;.
      </p>

      <h2>Why don&apos;t offers include comments and likes?</h2>

      <p>
        Spetito is only for posting and browsing friends&apos; offers. if
        someone offers an offer, then contacts his friend another by road, for
        example by telephone, or by a communication application such as theirs
        together. A platoon is also planned for Spetite in the future. The idea
        is that communication should only be between the bidder and the
        interested party; not among a group of stakeholders who may not even
        know each other.
