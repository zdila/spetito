      <h2>What is the mission of Spetito?</h2>

      <p>
        Spetito (<b>Spe</b>nd<b> ti</b>me<b> to</b>gether) is simple social
        network for giving non-binding offers to your friends, and from the
        opposite view, for a comprehensive overview of all offers from your
        friends. Offers may look like this:
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>
          I&apos;m going to downhill some Ko코ice singletrails. I welcome the
          biker company.
        </li>

        <li>
          I will be at the cottage in the evening and your visit will please me.
          The beer is cooled.
        </li>

        <li>
          This weekend I am planning a trip from 맚rbsk칠 pleso to Kriv치켿. The
          weather forecast looks very good.
        </li>

        <li>
          I will drive from Ko코ice to Bratislava on Friday and I will return on
          Sunday. Write me if you needs some transportation.
        </li>

        <li>
          I bake a great raw cake and I hope I won&apos;t eat it at home alone.
        </li>

        <li>I teach math 游땦</li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        We also plan to add groups for people sharing similar interests, ideally
        in the same location, for example:
        <i>Ko코ice dog owners</i>, <i>Pre코ov tourists</i>,
        <i>The lonely souls of Nitra</i>etc.
      </p>

      <h2>Why Facebook is not suitable for this?</h2>

      <p>
        Although Facebook contains events and it is also possible to post offers
        in messages, it contains a lot of other things that makes it impossible
        search for all relevant offers. The events on Facebook themselves are
        understood as invitations, while at Spetito they are (non-binding)
        offers, in the form similar to advertisements, but only within the
        circle of your friends. Few people will create a Facebook event that
        they are about to make a little jogging tonight and would love to have
        some company. Spetito is ideal for such offers.
      </p>

      <p>
        In addition, Facebook is full of irrelevant sponsored posts and
        advertising. You&apos;ll also never find some friends on Facebook,
        because not everyone &quot;loves it&quot;.
      </p>

      <h2>Why don&apos;t offers include comments and likes?</h2>

      <p>
        Spetito is only for posting and browsing friends&apos; offers. If
        someone is interested in the offer, then he/she contacts his/her friend
        for example by telephone, or by a communication application they usually
        use to talk together. A chat is also planned for Spetito in the future.
        The idea is that communication should only be between the offerrer and
        the interested party; not among a group of people interrested in a
        particular offer, who may not even know each other.
